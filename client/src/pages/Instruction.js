          Hot glue the wick to the bottom of an empty 4-ounce (120-milliliter) jar. Get a wick that already has a metal
          tab attached to it, and place a glob of hot glue on the bottom of the tab. Quickly press the tab against the
          bottom of the jar.

          Place two pencils over the mouth of the jar, and balance the wick between them. You can also use pens,
          markers, chopsticks, or even popsicle sticks. The goal is to keep the wick upright.

          Melt the wax. Put the wax into a glass measuring cup, then set the cup down in a large pot. Fill the pot with
          water until it is level with the wax; make sure that the water can&#39;t get inside the measuring cup. Bring
          the water to a boil over medium-high heat, and wait for the wax to melt, stirring it occasionallyHot glue the
